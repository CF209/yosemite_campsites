# yosemite_campsites

I created this script because I love Yosemite, but it was always hard to find a place to stay there. Campsites were almost impossible to book, so I created this script to scrape the website and notify me when sites become available.

Some basic information is hard coded into the script before it is run including the dates and links to the campgrounds you want to search. I would then set the script to run every 5 minutes on my computer.

If a campsite is found, a text is sent along with a unique code, and the campsite is held for 15 minutes. If you respond to the text using the unique code, the script will automatically book the campsite for you using the info hard coded at the top of the script.

Note: This script is outdated and no longer works since recreation.gov updated their website. I do not plan to update the script since there are now multiple free options online for finding available campsites
